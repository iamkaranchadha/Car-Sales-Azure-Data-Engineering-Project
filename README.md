# üöó Car Sales Azure Data Engineering Project

This project demonstrates a full-scale Azure Data Engineering solution to ingest, process, and model car sales data using a modern data architecture. It incorporates best practices like incremental loading, medallion architecture (Bronze, Silver, Gold), dimensional modeling, and pipeline orchestration.

## üîÑ Data Flow Steps

### 1. Ingest Data from API

* Used Azure Data Factory to call a car sales API
* Loaded initial data into Azure SQL Database
* Created a watermark table and stored procedure to support incremental loading

### 2. Move to Bronze Layer (Raw Zone)

* Used Azure SQL DB as a source and stored the data in Data Lake‚Äôs Bronze container in Parquet format
* Retained raw historical data for traceability

### 3. Transform into Silver Layer (Cleaned Zone)

* Read raw data in Databricks using PySpark
* Applied data cleaning, joins, formatting
* Stored cleansed and enriched data in the Silver container in Parquet format

### 4. Gold Layer (Business Model)

* Used Databricks notebooks with an incremental flag parameter to support:

  * Initial load
  * Incremental load logic (idempotent)
* Created SCD Type 1 dimensions and fact tables (star schema)
* Stored business-ready data in the Gold layer in Delta format
* Created Delta tables registered with Unity Catalog and Unity Metastore

### 5. Power BI Integration

* Connected Power BI to Gold Layer Delta tables

## ‚öôÔ∏è Pipeline Orchestration

* Created multiple Databricks notebooks for transformation logic

* Built modular ADF pipelines for:

  * API ingestion to Azure SQL
  * Azure SQL to Bronze
  * Notebook execution for Silver and Gold
* Designed a parent pipeline to orchestrate the entire workflow
* Configured scheduled triggers for daily automation
